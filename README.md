# Asm816: an assembler for W65C816-related microprocessors

This is an "unreleased" work in progress, uploaded so Kat could grab useful CPU bits for an emulator project.

## Currently implemented

* Instruction table and name index
* Assembly Tokenization

## In progress

* Assembly parsing
* In-memory object-code and rommable-linking

## Next

* Disassembler
* Timing analyzer
* GS/OS 6 OMF objects and executables
* NMOS 6502, various CMOS 65C02s, compatibility aliases
